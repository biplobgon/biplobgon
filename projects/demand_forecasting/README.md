# Demand Forecasting for E-commerce

## Overview
This project aims to forecast product demand using advanced time series models, including LSTM and Transformer architectures, to optimize inventory and supply chain operations for e-commerce businesses.

## Business Use Case
- **Goal:** Improve inventory management by predicting future product demand accurately.
- **Impact:** Reduce waste, avoid overstock, and streamline supply chain decisions.

## Data Collection
- **Sources:**  
  - Kaggleâ€™s M5 Forecasting Dataset (or similar sales data).  
  - Public datasets containing historical sales data.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Download the dataset and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
  2. Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, feature engineering).

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Normalize and structure the time-series data.
2. **Model Development:**  
   - Implement LSTM and Transformer-based models for time series forecasting.  
   - Compare performance with classical models like ARIMA and XGBoost.
3. **MLOps Pipeline:**  
   - Use MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning.  
   - Schedule regular training runs with Apache Airflow.
4. **Deployment:**  
   - Expose predictions via an API built with FastAPI.  
   - Deploy on AWS EC2 or SageMaker.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** TensorFlow/PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, MLflow, Airflow, FastAPI  
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, SageMaker)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
