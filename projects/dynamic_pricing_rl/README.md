# Dynamic Pricing Engine using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project develops a dynamic pricing engine that uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to adjust prices in real-time based on market demand, competitor pricing, and inventory levels.

## Business Use Case
- **Goal:** Optimize pricing strategies to maximize revenue.
- **Impact:** Enable e-commerce platforms to adjust prices dynamically in competitive markets.

## Data Collection
- **Sources:**  
  - Simulated e-commerce transaction data.
  - Historical sales and competitor pricing data.
- **Steps:**  
  1. Generate or collect transaction data.  
  2. Create a simulation environment using OpenAI Gym.

## Methodology
1. **Data Simulation:**  
   - Build a simulation environment with OpenAI Gym tailored for pricing.
2. **Model Development:**  
   - Implement RL algorithms such as Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).  
   - Train the RL agent within the simulation environment.
3. **MLOps Pipeline:**  
   - Monitor training performance using MLflow.  
   - Containerize the environment with Docker.
4. **Deployment:**  
   - Expose the pricing engine through a FastAPI-based service.  
   - Deploy on AWS (EC2/ECS).

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, Stable Baselines3, MLflow, Docker, FastAPI  
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, ECS)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
